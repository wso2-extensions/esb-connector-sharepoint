Product: Integration tests for WSO2 EI Sharepoint connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.8

Tested Platform: 

 - UBUNTU 16.04 LTS
 - WSO2 EI 6.1.1

Note:
    Set up a new SharePoint account and follow all the instruction given below in step 4 to generate an access token.

Steps to follow in setting integration test.

 1. Download EI 6.1.1 from official website.
 
 2. Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are add and enabled (conf\axis2\axis2.xml).
    <messageFormatter contentType="application/json;odata=verbose"
                                    class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonFormatter"/>
    <messageBuilder contentType="application/json;odata=verbose"
                                    class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonBuilder"/>

    <messageFormatter contentType="application/octet-stream"
                                    class="org.apache.axis2.format.BinaryFormatter"/>
    <messageBuilder contentType="binary/octet-stream"
                                    class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

    When you call createCustomListItem connector method with blocking mode and getAccessTokenFromRefreshToken, you need to add the following
    builders and formatter in axis2_blocking_client.xml

    <messageFormatter contentType="application/json;odata=verbose"
                                    class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamFormatter"/>
    <messageBuilder contentType="application/json;odata=verbose"
                                    class="org.apache.synapse.commons.json.JsonStreamBuilder"/>

    <messageFormatter contentType="application/octet-stream"
                                    class="org.apache.axis2.format.BinaryFormatter"/>
    <messageBuilder contentType="binary/octet-stream"
                                    class="org.wso2.carbon.relay.BinaryRelayBuilder"/>

 3. Create a office365 account using URL https://login.microsoftonline.com/ , and click SharePoint.
        Note: This is a 30-day free trial account.

 4. Follow the bellow mentioned steps to generate the access token:
        i)      Log in to your Office365 account, and go to the following URLs:
                   https://your_site_name.com/_layouts/15/appregnew.aspx
        ii)     Set the following options:
                    App Type—Select An app running on a web server.
                    Client Id—Click Generate, and copy the generated value to a text file.
                    Client Secret—Click Generate, and copy the generated value to a text file.
                    Title—Enter a name for the app.
                    App Domain—Enter the domain name.
                    Redirect URL— Enter the Callback URL.
        iii)    Click Create.
                    Now you’ll configure the newly created app to access SharePoint resources.
        iv)     Get the Realm of your site.Realm is a constant GUID for a site. Save this realm for future use.
        vi)     Get the Authorization code from Azure Access Control Service
                Construct the authorization url as follows:
                     https://your_site.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/OAuthAuthorize.aspx?client_id=client_GUID&scope=app_permissions_list&response_type=code&redirect_uri=redirect_uri
                Set the scop=Web.Manage
        vii)    Once you grant the permission (by clicking trust), SharePoint Online site asks ACS to create a authorization code unique to this combination of user and app.
                ACS sends the authorization code to the SharePoint site.
                SharePoint Online site redirects the browser back to the redirect URI that was specified when the app was registered in step i) and ii).
                It also includes the authorization code as a query string. The redirect URL is structured like the following:
                    https://redirect_url/?code=<authcode>
                Extract query string value code from above url and it will be used in next step.
        Viii)   Get the access token and refresh token from code:
                    Construct the below post request:
                    https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/<site_realm>/tokens/OAuth/2
                    Post parameters:
                    grant_type=authorization_code
                    &client_id=<client_id>@<site_realm>
                    &client_secret=<client_secret>
                    &code=<auth_code>
                    &redirect_uri=<redirect_url>
                    &resource=< audience principal ID>/<site_host>@<site_realm>
        ix)    Get the access token and refresh token from code:
                    This step is almost similar to step   Viii), except 2 differences. Here the difference is that we use:
                           *    grant_type as refresh_token and
                           *    refresh_token instead of code in step4 and use the refresh token which we have saved in step4.
                    https://accounts.accesscontrol.windows.net/<site_realm>/tokens/OAuth/2
